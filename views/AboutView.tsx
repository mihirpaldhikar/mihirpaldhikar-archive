            <p>
                Bonjour! I am <span
                className={"text-purple-900"}>Mihir Paldhikar</span>, <br/> passionate about
                computers, coding and learning about science. <br/> <br/>
                I like to create new projects thus always brain-storming about ideas
                ðŸ’¡. <br/><br/>
                Programming since I was 14, computers got my interest from thinking how to
                these cool stuff actually work! <br/> <br/>
                My first attempt to code was building a Flash Light app for Android, but
                fortunately it crashed on first run thus made me to explore more about
                programming in general.
